Web Applications
-------

**Instagram Auto post/submitter** - "I need an app or script that will run on my phone that will log into my instagram account, post an image and caption, and then delete and repost the image and caption according to the time frame I assign.  So, for example maybe 'post for 20 minutes' then delete then wait 10 minutes and post it again. Or maybe I can select an option for 'random' for example, 'between 5-10 minute wait then repost'.

I don't care if the app or script is ugly or unattractive.  This is only for my personal use.  I just need something that is reliable and works. I need it to be local, on my phone only and not connected to any server or anything else outside my phone." 

**equipment tracker** - "the web app must be able to track maintenance on a specific piece of equipment.  For example, we may have a bulldozer deployed (Equipment # is unique).  For each piece of equipment (based on the equipment #) we will need to track the Make, Model, and Serial number.   Each piece of equipment will need to have a certain number of ‘hours’ assigned between service.  This will be a different hour value for each piece of equipment.

There will need to be a location table to track the location (jobsite / main office) of the equipment.   Perhaps just a jobsite ID, Name and address

For each piece of equipment, we will need to track the service history for the equipment.   The service being tracked will be number of hours when serviced, type of service, notes. "

**Car Repair Shop** - "I want to build a Car Repair Shop booking system where customers can book services online. They must be able to search their local area via postal or zip code, the results will show x amount of garages with ratings. Customer can then click on the garage which will show a profile for that workshop and the services they have to offer. It would basically be like a hotel booking system."



Mobile Applications
-----------------

**task & budgets app** - "an app that manages task and budgets between children and parents. The app will be highly interactive and will reward children after each task is done. The app will also feature a section where the child can add tasks, the parents approve, each approval is assigned a monetary amount. Other sections will include lists for planning, wishlists, etc."

Scripts
--------

**auto-printer** - automate a printing process using autoit (for instance, a script that will print page 1 of a PDF document to a specific tray of a specific printer, Page 2 of the same document to a different tray, and Page 3 to an entirely different printer).Scripts will also need table to automatically move files from one folder to another after printing.
